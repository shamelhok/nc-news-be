# Hosting a PSQL DB using ElephantSQL and Render

There are many ways to host APIs online. In these notes we will be using [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) to create an online location for your database, and [Render](https://render.com/) to host the API. Render also offers free postgres hosting, but only for 90 days so we'll use a separate service to host our database.

## 1. Make a GitHub repo for your API

**_NB_** You will only need to follow this step if you have not already created a new repo for this project. If you are following these notes for BE-Review week, you will **not** need to complete this step

Follow the below instructions to do so.

1. Create a new _public_ GitHub repository, and do **not** initialise the project with a readme, .gitignore or license.
2. From your _local_ copy of your repository, push your code to your new repository using the following commands:

```bash
git remote set-url origin YOUR_NEW_REPO_URL_HERE
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Set up an instance of your database using ElephantSQL

Create an account on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/), or you can link a GitHub or a Google account to log in.

You will need to create a team, which you can name whatever you like. You'll need to answer "Yes" to the Terms of Service and GDPR statements, and provide them with an email address.

Once you have created a team, navigate to "Create a New Instance", which you can also name whatever you like - we suggest something appropriate to the database you're creating. Make sure you choose the free "Tiny Turtle" plan üê¢, then click "Select Region".

_There are options to add credit card and billing info, ignore them, you don't need to!_

Select any region. This will be the location of your hosted server, so it may be slightly beneficial to choose a location closer to you. Click "Review", then "Create Instance".

Now you have your server instance, click on it's name so you're on the "Details" page.

We will need the **URL** for the next part (this will start with "postgres://..." ). Copy it to your clipboard for now, or keep this tab open for the next step!

## 3. Add your production .env file to your local repo

We will need to provide an environment variable for our production DB called `DATABASE_URL`. This will provide the online location of the DB you have just created.

Add a new .env file called `.env.production`.

In it replace the `<URL>` with the value you got in the previous step.

```
DATABASE_URL=<URL>
```

## 4. Update your connection pool

At the top of the file that creates and exports your connection pool (this may be called something like `connection.js`), assign the value of the NODE_ENV to a variable (you may have already created this variable):

```js
const ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
```

It is important to check that we have either the development/test PGDATABASE variable or the production DATABASE_URL. If both are missing from the `process.env`, then throw an error.

```js
if (!process.env.PGDATABASE && !process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error('PGDATABASE or DATABASE_URL not set');
}
```

Next, add a `config` variable. If the `ENV` is "production", this variable should hold a config object, containing the `DATABASE_URL` at the `connectionString` key. This allows you to connect to the hosted database from your local machine. The `max` property limits how many connections the Pool will have available as free Elephant databases only support up to 5 concurrent connections. We're not using them all for the server so that we can manually connect if we need to.

```js
const ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
// ...
const config =
  ENV === 'production'
    ? {
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
        max: 2,
      }
    : {};

module.exports = new Pool(config);
// ...
```

## 5. Add a listen file

If you haven't already, we will need to add a `listen.js` file at the top level of our folder, which we will provide to our hosting provider so they know how to get our app started.

```js
const app = require('./app.js');
const { PORT = 9090 } = process.env;

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Listening on ${PORT}...`));
```

## 6. Update your package.json

In your `package.json` file, set your "main" key to your listen.js file. Missing this will result in an error from our hosting provider, as it won't know where to enter the app.

```json
"main": "listen.js"
```

Add the following keys to the scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node listen.js",
    "seed-prod": "NODE_ENV=production npm run seed"
  }
}
```

Also make sure your `dotenv` and `pg` dependencies are in your _dependencies_, not your _devDependencies_, as Render will need access to these libraries.

_If you haven't already, push all your changes to GitHub!_

## 7. Seed your online database

Your `package.json` should have a `seed-prod` script (if it doesn't, check the previous step).

**Run the seed-prod script**

```bash
npm run seed-prod
```

This script should check whether you're in production, and if you are, it should connect to the production database. If you have other .env files (you might not!), leave them as they are.

You can test if this has worked by going to the "Browser" section in the control panel of your ElephantSQL [instance](https://customer.elephantsql.com/instance). Here you can add queries, just make sure not to try out any that might break your database! Stick to `SELECT`s, rather than `DELETE`s or `INSERT`s.

## 8. Get your API hosted using render

Sign up to [Render](https://render.com/). Once you're signed up, click on the "New +" button and create a new `Web Service`.

You can connect your github account and give the app permission to access your apps repo, alternatively you can paste in the URL of your git repository, providing it is a public repo

Once you have selected your repo, give your app a name. Most of the options can be left on their default settings, hosted in the EU using the main branch. The default commands can be left as is. (yarn is a package manager, an alternative to npm)

At the bottom, underneath the payment tier options you will have the option to provide some environment variables by clicking on the `Advanced` button.

You will need to add the following variables yourself using the `Add Environment Variable` button.

1. Set `DATABASE_URL` to your database's URL (the same one you put in your `.env.production`).
2. Set `NODE_ENV` to the string "production" (you won't need to add the quotes).

Create your service and it will begin the deploy process. This will take a few minutes the first time so be patient. If you have made a mistake, or forgotten to add environment variables you can select the `Environment` tab on your app dashboard. Once you have saved any changes Render will re-deploy your app with the new environment.

You can see the progress on this by following the links on the `Events` tab and any logs from your server are shown on the Logs tab.

There's a link to your hosted app at the top of the page. Check your endpoints are working, and you're good to go! üéâ

nb The link is to the '/' path which your server will correctly 404. Make a request to an existing endpoint such as /api/users to check your getting data from the db correctly.
